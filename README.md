# node-red-contrib-ui-plotly
A node-RED contrib node to deliver Plotly charts

### DO NOT USE! - work in progress!!


## TODO's
- [ ] Support build-in colorscales https://plotly.com/python/builtin-colorscales/
- [ ] Create endpoint to allow a "Validate" button in the config screen
- [ ] Pass the selected array to Plotly
- [ ] What to do with the `any` data type?
- [ ] Add validation of arrays (based on the array type)
- [ ] Solve error *"Indices must be valid indices for gd.data"*
- [ ] Determine how  to pick which array (in the input message) contains the data for the x-axis. --> typedinput 'msg' or 'fixed' on the first tabsheet??
- [ ] Currently, the assumption is that the x-axis is a timestamp, auto generated by the node, but it will not always be the case, and we may need to be able to select the x-axis from the incoming data arrays, such as;
   ```
   {
	   "month":["January","February","March"],
	   "rainfall":["4.6","4.9","9.3"],
	   "sunshine":["6.7","7.8","10"]
   }
   ```
   And have a further option to tell plotly how to format the x-axis timestamps - tickformat
   ```
   {
	   "date":["2020-07-24 16:49:29","2020-07-24 16:59:29","2020-07-24 17:09:29"],
	   "rainfall":["4.6","4.9","9.3"],
	   "sunshine":["6.7","7.8","10"]
   }
   ```
   Should there be an option in trace config to add a trace to either the x or y axis (there would only be 1 x-axis)
- [ ] Fix header lines on the editableLists: they need to be properly aligned with the columns below, even when the config screen is resized.
- [ ] Make sure the editableLists always expand to the full available area's.  See updateEditorHeight(node,node.editor)
- [ ] What to do with the yAxisType?
- [ ] Some traces hav not only "attributes" but also "layoutAttributes".  What to do with those?
- [ ] Disable "properties" tabsheet, when no traces are availalbe
- [ ] Disable "items" tabsheet, when no arrays are availalbe
- [ ] Which step size do we need to specify on input of type "number" and "angle"?
- [ ] When a tabsheet opens, set the focus on a field.
